# CrazyWeatherApp

This is a JS web app to find out about the weather in realtime of any city in the world: https://crazyweatherapp.herokuapp.com/.

I built this app to learn about: 
<ol>
	<li>Setting up a back-end server on <b>node.JS</b> (Express framework)  </li>
	<li>Building a simple front end with <b>Bootstrap</b> </li>
	<li>Adding animations to display dynamically elements at every refresh (with Animate.css) to let the user reorder cities in list (with Jquery UI)</li> 
	<li>Setting up, reading and updating a <b>mongo DB database</b> (Mongoose Framework)</li>
	<li>Using several <b>web microservices</b>:</li> 
	<ol>
		<li>Retrieving realtime weather information : https://openweathermap.org/ </li>
		<li>Displaying cities on a map : https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/</li>
		<li>Insuring autocomplete of cities in the search bar : https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/autocomplete</li>
	</ol>
</ol>;
