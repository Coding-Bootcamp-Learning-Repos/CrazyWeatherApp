# CrazyWeatherApp

This is a JS web app to find out about the weather in realtime of any city in the world: https://crazyweatherapp.herokuapp.com/.

I built this app to learn about:
> Setting up a back-end server on node.JS (Express framework)  
> Setting up, reading and updating a mongo DB database (Mongoose Framework)
> Using several web microservices: 
  -- Retrieving realtime weather information : https://openweathermap.org/ 
  -- Displaying cities on a map : https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/
  -- Insuring autocomplete of cities in the search bar : https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/autocomplete
> Building a simple front end with Bootstrap 
> Adding animations through 
  -- displaying elements after evry refresh : Animate.css
  -- letting the user reorder the cities in his list : Jquery UI
